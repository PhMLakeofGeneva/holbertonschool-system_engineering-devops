Scenario: User Accessing the Website "www.foobar.com"
User Request: A user opens a browser and types "www.foobar.com" in the address bar.
DNS Resolution:
The user's computer sends a request to resolve the domain name "www.foobar.com" into an IP address.
The DNS system matches the www record, a CNAME (Canonical Name Record), which points to foobar.com. The domain "foobar.com" has an A (Address Record) pointing to the IP address 8.8.8.8, which is the public IP of the server hosting the website.
Routing: The user's request is routed to the server at IP 8.8.8.8 through the internet.
Infrastructure Breakdown (Single Server with LAMP Stack)
The Server (IP: 8.8.8.8):

The server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the website and runs the web server, application server, and database.
Operating System: Ubuntu (or any other Linux distribution)
Role: The server’s job is to provide computational resources, storage, and networking to serve the website. It manages requests from users, executes web applications, stores data, and sends back responses.
The Domain Name ("foobar.com"):

A domain name is a human-readable address used to access a website instead of remembering the server’s IP address.
Role: The domain name translates into the IP address of the server, allowing users to access the website via “www.foobar.com” rather than using an IP address directly.
www Record Type: This is a CNAME record that points "www.foobar.com" to "foobar.com". The root domain "foobar.com" has an A record pointing to the server’s IP address (8.8.8.8).
Web Server (Nginx):

Role: Nginx is responsible for handling incoming HTTP(S) requests from users and routing them to the correct application server. It acts as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and static file server.
When the user types "www.foobar.com", Nginx receives the request and forwards it to the application server.
Application Server:

Role: The application server is where the backend logic of the website resides. It runs the dynamic code (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) that processes user input and generates the dynamic content of the website.
The application server processes user requests (e.g., login, data retrieval), interacts with the database, and sends the appropriate response back to Nginx.
Application Files (Code Base):

Role: These are the scripts, web pages, and configuration files that make up the website's backend logic. For example, PHP files that query the database and generate the HTML pages.
Database (MySQL):

Role: The database stores all the website's data in a structured manner. For example, user data, blog posts, or product information. The application server queries the database to fetch or update this data.
MySQL: An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores and retrieves website data.
Communication Flow Between Components:
The user's browser communicates with the web server (Nginx) via the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
Nginx forwards the request to the application server, which processes the request using the application code.
The application server interacts with the MySQL database to fetch or update any data needed for the request.
The result (usually an HTML page) is passed back to Nginx, which then sends it to the user’s browser, where it is rendered.
Issues with This Single-Server Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

Since everything (web server, application server, and database) is hosted on a single server, if the server goes down (e.g., hardware failure, crash), the entire website becomes unavailable. This is a critical weakness in terms of reliability.
Downtime During Maintenance:

Anytime you need to update the codebase, upgrade the application, or restart services (e.g., Nginx or MySQL), the website will experience downtime. Users won’t be able to access the site while changes are being deployed, which could result in poor user experience.
Scalability Issues:

This setup cannot handle high traffic efficiently. Since all services are running on a single server, performance will degrade as more users access the site. There is no way to balance the load or distribute traffic across multiple servers. If too many requests come in, the server might become overwhelmed, leading to slow response times or crashes.
Summary:
Server: A single machine at IP 8.8.8.8 hosting Nginx, the application server, and the MySQL database.
Web Server (Nginx): Handles user requests and forwards them to the application server.
Application Server: Runs the backend logic of the site, processes dynamic requests.
Database (MySQL): Stores structured website data.
Domain Name ("www.foobar.com"): Translates into the server’s IP address using a CNAME and A record.
Communication: Occurs over HTTP/HTTPS from the user's browser to the server.
Issues: Single point of failure, downtime during maintenance, and inability to scale easily with increased traffic.
This basic infrastructure is suitable for small, low-traffic websites but would need improvements (load balancing, redundancy, etc.) for larger, high-traffic applications.
